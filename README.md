# PURE-DATA


Markov System patches only output MIDI. Use them to trigger MIDI messages to your D.A.W. Edit your sound configuration and set up a universal MIDI bus, (IAC driver for mac, I'm not sure what its called for windows) then set this as the MIDI I/O's on Pure Data and your D.A.W then you can use the Pure Data patches to trigger any VST/AU you want.
