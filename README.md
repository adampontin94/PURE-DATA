# PURE-DATA


Markov Chain programs only output MIDI data so you need to run them in conjunction with your D.A.W. Set-up a universal MIDI bus in your sound configuration (IAC driver for mac) and change the I/O's in Pure Data and your D.A.W then you can run the patches to trigger plugins. The first-order system works on its own and will generate a composition in C major. To run the second-order system you need to load a MIDI file and it will generate a sequence of notes based on the pitches it is given. There is also a separate first-order Markov chain system to determine the length of time between notes which can be edited to suit your preference. The drum machine & synth sequencer works indepently and just generates auio straight to the DAC.
